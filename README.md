### Basic ASP.NET Core
This template is conceptually somewhere between the current _Empty_ and
_Web Application_ templates. It is great for learning about ASP.NET Core
as well as a clean starting point for creating any type of web application
including SPA.

It doesn't include any client-side libraries or tooling, so there is no
Bower, npm, Gulp or Bundler.
